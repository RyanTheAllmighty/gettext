# gettext
GNU gettext Internationalization (i18n) for Java-based video games

## Purpose

This implementation uses only a single dependency (antlr4-runtime) and avoids usage of reflection and ResourceBundle to allow for cross-compilation to other platforms. Though made for video games, it is possible to use it any Java-based application.
